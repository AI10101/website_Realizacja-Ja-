# website_Realizacja-Ja-

Website has simple navbar and footer (in theory also working on mobiles)
I changed footer design a little bit as the original project had no proportions at all and was almost impossible to code scalable. For now we just live it as it is, later we will see.

What needs to be done:
- change dummy links for real ones (later)
- add landing page content
- check for problems when scaling or running on mobiles (maybe center footer elements on mobiles)
